,5:25 PM,Analyzing Large-Scale User Data with Hadoop and HBase,,"Doing data science at scale on Hadoop and HBase is difficult, and data about users presents unique challenges. In this talk you will learn why user-centric data is different from other types of large data, and how to leverage the right data layout to build an integrated analysis and serving platform. We will describe an architecture designed to perform these analyses (WiBiData), see real-world examples of user-centric data analysis solutions, and talk about the potential future of user data analysis.",,,,Aaron  Kimball,CTO,WibiData
