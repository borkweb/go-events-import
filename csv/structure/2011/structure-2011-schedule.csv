,8:40 AM,A Tale of Two Clouds: Private and Mobile,,"There are two clouds that when combined provide a big threat to the established practices and controls of the IT department. The first cloud, the private cloud, lacks two important attributes of cloud computing.  First, you have to buy it up front – instead of paying for it as you go, and second, the adoption of cloud means almost no IT involvement.  The second kind of kind of cloud is the ""Cloud in your pocket"" - the one that powers your smartphone or tablet. This talk will look at the infrastructural requirements to deliver both kinds of clouds, examine the state of development of such infrastructure generally, and propose a way forward for IT to enable enterprises to serve both consumer use of client devices and enterprise policy needs.",,,,Simon Crosby,"CTO, Datacenter and Cloud Division",Citrix Systems
,9:00 AM,New Directions for the Cloud,,"The cloud has come so far so quickly it’s tempting to think that we’ve reached maturity, but there are likely to be numerous discontinuities in the next few years. In this dialogue, Lew Tucker, Cisco’s cloud computing vice president and chief technology officer, and Joe Weinman, HP exec and founder of Cloudonomics, discuss what’s coming next.  How will OpenStack and Cisco’s Networking-as-a-Service contribution and HP’s Open Cloud Marketplace impact the industry?  How much of IT will be in private vs. public clouds?  Will the industry be dominated by over-the-top players?  Or will telcos, regional players, and vertical specialists have the biggest role?  Is the megadatacenter the ultimate architecture, and if not, what current assumptions may be overturned? A great talk that will help map out issues to be discussed over the next two days and the next 18 months.",,,,Lew Tucker,"VP and CTO, Cloud Computing",Cisco
