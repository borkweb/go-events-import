1:30 PM,PANEL,Toward Cloud Computing: Private Enterprise Clouds As A First Step,"Enterprises are cautious about migrating their most demanding applications to public clouds. Public cloud infrastructure can’t run all existing enterprise applications, particularly the most mission critical, without some modification and more advanced management software.  IT also faces concerns about security and control.  Yet the lure of self-service provisioning and usage-based pricing is still strong. The solution? Build your own cloud with your existing infrastructure investment as a first step. This panel will explore how enterprise clouds are likely to take shape, building on the evolution of virtualization infrastructure and systems management technology as a foundation.",George Gilbert,Co-Founder and Partner,TechAlpha,Kia Behnia,CTO,BMC Software,
