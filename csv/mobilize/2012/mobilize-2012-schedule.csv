,8:30 AM,The future speaks. Again.,,"As the consumer uses multiple apps and multiple devices, Siri has the potential to tie them all together with just one voice command, changing the way we interact with not only our smartphones but also all of our connected devices. We will soon be able to organize our lives via a virtual assistant. But will interaction with our smartphones evolve beyond voice commands and touch? Will devices smell, see or feel? Sensors and user-interface technologies are being developed for a number of different applications and vertical markets. We will explore whether the mobile device is where we want to tie them all together and how we can keep these interfaces simple and intuitive.",Derek Kerton,"Principal Analyst, The Kerton Group and Analyst",GigaOM Pro,Yoon Kim,CEO,Novauris Technologies

,8:50 AM,Building a private social network,,"Private social networks have been gaining traction, but it is a lot more difficult to achieve scale, especially if the network is mobile-only. In this session we ask whether this long-haul strategy can work, especially if private social networks can scale to the size of a Facebook or Twitter. We also discuss how the fewer, more meaningful interactions among users in a closed environment mean you can have a fundamentally different monetization strategy.

,9:30 AM,The connected-car experience,,"People don't want to give up connectivity just because they are in the car. So what does the in-car connected experience look like? Some carmakers envision a more streamlined service with a familiar feel, ensuring less cognitive processing by the driver. How can Silicon Valley work with the car industry on its current fragmented platforms, especially when life cycles for technologies in the two industries are completely different? Carmakers want to work with third parties to affordably bring content into the car and enable a personalized connected experience, but they also want some level of control over the interface. Can a partnership like this work?",Katie Fehrenbacher,Senior Writer,GigaOM,Robert Acker,VP and GM,Aha by Harman

,9:50 AM,Instagram: the story behind the instant scaling for a runaway hit,,"It's a classic Silicon Valley story. Two guys at college decide to create an app. Two years and 80 million users later they are bought for $1 billion. The app and the business story are well-known, but what is the real tale behind the infrastructure that powers this juggernaut of an app? What can others learn from their choices? We talk to one of the founders about the story behind the scalable back end that is run by a small team.",Om Malik,Founder and Senior Writer,GigaOM,Mike Krieger,Co-Founder,Instagram

One of the big components of its Network Vision initiative will be a heterogeneous network, or hetnet, which will create a dense layer of small cells in high-traffic areas underneath Sprint's macro network umbrella.

,1:50 PM,What's a mobile entrepreneur to do next?,,"Mobile is the most successful technology ever, but on the surface of it the opportunities for ambitious entrepreneurs look bleak. Apps make money, but only for a few. Handsets are pretty much the same black touch-tablet form everywhere, and who hears of any real new innovation for wireless network technology? So where does the mobile entrepreneur look for new opportunities? We speak with Rich Miner, a partner at Google Ventures who co-founded Android, founded and ran Orange's Imagineering Unit, pioneered computer graphics as a professor, and now as a venture capitalist is looking for the next big mobile idea.

As more apps and services are provisioned from the mobile cloud, how can companies and carriers better performance on mobile devices?

,4:10 PM,The business model for mobile wellness,,"Even though informed consumers are shifting the health-care paradigm away from the current physician-led system, mobile-health apps do not tend to make it to the top of app stores. However, download revenue, advertisement sales and device sales make a compelling business model. Health-monitoring functions combined with easy-to-use interfaces and options for direct data sharing have driven adoption and have also proved to be the best way of marketing a mobile health-care device. Mobile-health app developers are also well-positioned as collectors of vast amounts of medical data for their users, ideal for personalizing recommendations for improving health but also for recommending new products. How are m-health companies utilizing the data they collect?",Jody Ranck,Analyst,GigaOM Pro,Jason Jacobs,CEO and Founder,RunKeeper

,9:05 AM,The state of SoLoMo and the in-store experience,,"Mobile commerce is already being shaped by SoLoMo, but as major retailers already possess valuable information about their customers, targeting them with products while they are in the store or nearby is the next step.

,9:35 AM,Taking a bite from the Apple: disrupting the app-distribution model,,"Savvy developers are working around app stores by hurtling toward the freemium-focused business model and monetizing in-app purchases instead. Distribution alternatives are also emerging: Developers are finding new channels and ways to increase app discovery, especially if they serve a niche market and a direct-distribution model is more effective.

Given that cost is a major barrier to adoption for students, content producers will need to transform the way they create and distribute material in order to increase uptake. The greatest challenge for digital publishing may actually lie in getting students to adapt their own learning styles, retraining teachers, and getting the education system to adapt. What sort of content will lead to a more personalized learning experience, and how do the needs of university departments differ? In this fragmented market, what new ways will emerge to distribute content online, and what can we learn from other models being adopted in other industries?

This re-platforming has given rise to a whole new set of challenges that were not present on the desktop web: offline syncing, spotty connections and a fragmented mobile landscape. Much of the technology stack that worked for desktop web apps has to be rebuilt from scratch, and it needs to be rebuilt for each mobile device type too.",Stacey Higginbotham,Senior Writer,GigaOM,Kevin Lacker,CTO,Parse
